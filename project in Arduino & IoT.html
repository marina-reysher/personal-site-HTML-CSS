    <h2>Project in Arduino & IoT</h2>
    <p class="projectP">We created a remote-controlled entertaining system for pets.<br> We used the
      <strong>Arduino platform</strong> to make sure that the pet is hydrated and
      entertained.<br> We built our application on the <strong>Xamarin platform.
      </strong> The user has the option to start from a distance the entertaining
      car or to pour the pet some water.The water dispenser has a button the
      pet can press and pour himself water.We used the <strong>Azure database
      </strong> to save data such as the number of times that the pet pressed the
      water button and the amount of water that he drank.Each button press
      triggered an https request that activated the car or the water dispenser.<br>
      <strong>Final grade: 91</strong><br>
